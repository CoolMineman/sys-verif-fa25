<h3>Learning objectives</h3>

<p>By the end of this class, you should be able to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Articulate the guarantees of formal verification</li>
  <li>Write and understand specifications</li>
  <li>Verify simple programs in an imperative language</li>
</ol>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<p>
  There is no specific course or background that is required to learn
  verification. However, some "mathematical maturity" and programming skill is
  needed: the mathematical maturity since we will be stating and proving precise
  theorems, the programming since you'll be learning a new programming language
  (Coq) to write proofs in.
</p>

<h3>Assignments</h3>
<p>
  There will be two programming exercises in Coq, one written theory assignment,
  and a final project in Coq.
</p>

<p>Grading: TBD</p>

<p>Handin: TBD (probably Canvas)</p>

<h3>Late policy</h3>
<p>
  For the programming exercises and theory assignment, you get 3 "late days" to
  use throughout the semester. You don't need to tell me to use them, just
  submit late. If you have extenuating circumstances and need more time, let me
  know as soon as possible.
</p>

<h3>Student well-being</h3>
<p>
  I realize this class isn’t the only thing in your life. If this class ever
  feels overwhelming on top of whatever else you're responsible for, please let
  me know and we can work something out. Do this early! I don’t want it to
  stress you out, I want you to learn something.
</p>
