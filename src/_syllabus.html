<h3>Late policy</h3>
<p>
  For the programming exercises and theory assignment, you get 3 "late days" to
  use throughout the semester. You don't need to tell me to use them, just
  submit late. If you have extenuating circumstances and need more time, let me
  know as soon as possible.

<h3>Student well-being</h3>
<p>
  I realize this class isn’t the only thing in your life. If this class ever
  feels overwhelming on top of whatever else you're responsible for, please let
  me know and we can work something out. Do this early! I don’t want it to
  stress you out, I want you to learn something.
