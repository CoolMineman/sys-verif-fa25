Inductive data types, recursive functions

Proofs by induction, computation, and rewriting

Specifying (functional) abstract data types

## Imperative programs

Hoare logic; weakest preconditions

Separation logic to deal with the heap; frame rule

Soundness theorem

## Concurrent programs

Weakest precondition for Fork

Concurrent soundness theorem

Fractional permissions

Resource algebras and ghost state

## Coq

Writing definitions and theorems

Writing proofs with tactics

Translating informal proof strategy to tactics

Interactive proofs: reading the context, finding existing lemmas
