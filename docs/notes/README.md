# Lecture notes

These notes are the textbook of the class. I encourage you to read the lecture notes for a lecture afterward. The notes will include additional details and exercises that we won't get to in class.

Some chapters include a tag "literate" at the top. These are generated from Coq sources that are also distributed in the course [exercises repo](https://github.com/tchajed/sys-verif-fa24-proofs).
