# Lecture notes

These notes are the textbook of the class. I encourage you to read the lecture notes for a lecture afterward. The notes will include additional details and exercises that we won't get to in class.

Some chapters include a tag "literate" at the top. These are generated from Coq sources that are also distributed in the course [exercises repo](https://github.com/tchajed/sys-verif-fa24-proofs).

There are exercises throughout the notes, many with solutions. I _highly_ recommend making an attempt at any exercise before looking at the solution, and if you're skimming to resist the temptation to open up the solutions. You'll learn much more by doing the exercises on your own than by passively reading. A small number of exericses are graded homework, but don't let that stop you from doing them and writing out the answers - and if you're unsure feel free to send me a solution and ask about it.
