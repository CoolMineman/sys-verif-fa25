# Assignment 1: Coq

The goal of this assignment is to get you some familiarity with proving theorems in Coq. You'll also be getting started with verification by proving properties about functional programs - eventually we'll move on to reasoning about imperative programs.

## Part 0: setup

The [main assignments page](../) has instructions on getting the sys-verif-fa24-proofs repo and Coq set up. Follow those first.

::: warning
Getting the software set up can be difficult, so do it early and ask for help quickly if you get stuck.

## Part 1: Basics from Software Foundations

First, you'll read [Basics](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/lf-current/Basics.html), the first chapter of the online textbook Software Foundations, and do the exercises there. Do the exercises in the Basics.v file in the proofs repo. The online version is the same as the Coq version, just with a pretty HTML rendering.

Only two parts of this chapter are optional:

- You can skip the "Fixpoints and Structural Recursion" section.
- We aren't using the autograder described in "Testing your solutions". To test your solutions in this class just run `make` (in the VS Code terminal if you're using Docker). Please make sure your code compiles before submitting; use `Admitted` to end proofs you didn't finish (and check that you didn't unintentionally leave something admitted).

::: important
This chapter has a lot of small, easy exercises to get you practice. If these are difficult, that's a bad sign. If they're easy, note that proofs will become more difficult quickly after this.

## Part 2: verifying functional programs

TODO: provide additional exercises
