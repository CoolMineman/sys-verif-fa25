# Assignment 3: Separation Logic theory

::: info
This is a theory assignment: you'll submit written responses rather than doing proofs in a computer.
:::

In this assignment, you'll answer some questions about separation logic on paper rather than submitting mechanized proofs. The goal is to build and exercise your mental model for these concepts, especially specifications, without spending too much time in details. The downside is that there's no computer patiently checking your work and confirming when you're done; you'll have to think about it and wait for (much slower) feedback.
