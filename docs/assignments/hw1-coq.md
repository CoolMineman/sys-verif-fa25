# Assignment 1: Coq

The goal of this assignment is to get you some familiarity with proving theorems in Coq. You'll also be getting started with verification by proving properties about functional programs - eventually we'll move on to reasoning about imperative programs.

## Part 0: setup

The [main assignments page](../) has instructions on getting the sys-verif-fa24-proofs repo and Coq set up. Follow those first.

::: warning

Getting the software set up can be difficult, so do it early and ask for help quickly if you get stuck.

## Part 1: Basics from Software Foundations

First, you'll read Basics, the first chapter of the online textbook Software Foundations, and do the exercises there. Only two parts are optional:

- You can skip the "Fixpoints and Structural Recursion" section if you'd like.
- We aren't using the autograder, so you can ignore the instructions in "Testing your solutions". To test your solutions in this class just run `make`. Please make sure your code compiles before submitting; use `Admitted` to end proofs you didn't finish (and check that you didn't unintentionally leave something admitted.)

Read the chapter and do the exercises marked with `FILL IN HERE` in Basics.v in the proofs repo.

::: important

This chapter has a lot of small, easy exercises to get you practice. If these are difficult, that's a bad sign. If they're easy, note that proofs will become more difficult quickly after this.

## Part 2: verifying functional programs

TODO: provide additional exercises
