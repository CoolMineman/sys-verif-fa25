# Final project

For the final project, you'll pick something to verify. The details are still to be finalized, but here are the rough parameters.

The idea here is for you to explore something you're interested in and complete a more substantial proof. I'll give 1-2 straightforward options, 1-2 more difficult ideas. Beyond these you're welcome to propose something, but you need to schedule a meeting to explain what you're planning so I can give feedback (mainly so I can confirm the scope is reasonable).
