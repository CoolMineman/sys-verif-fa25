# Assignment 3: Verifying Go programs

In this assignment you'll verify imperative programs written in Go. All your proofs should be carried out in the exercises repo (sys-verif-fa24-proofs). The various parts of the assignment are divided among files in `src/sys_verif/assignment3`; each part is independent.

Submit your work by running `./etc/prepare-submit` and uploading `hw.tar.gz` to the Canvas assignment.

::: warning Draft

This assignment is very nearly done (you can and should start on it), but I will be adding point values and some more advice to this page. The Canvas assignment also hasn't been created yet.

:::

Part 1 is intended as a warmup and Part 4 has an open-ended component (you'll write almost the entire proof yourself). Please take this into account when planning how to work on the assignment.

## Part 1: Inferring specifications

See [Inferring specifications](./infer_specs.md).

## Part 2: Verify factorial

See [Factorial](./factorial_proof.md).

## Part 3: Linked lists

## Part 4: Queue using two stacks
