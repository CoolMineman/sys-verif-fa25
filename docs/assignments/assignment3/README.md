This assignment is very nearly done (you can and should start on it), but I will be adding point values and some more advice to this page.

Part 1 is intended as a warmup and Part 4 has an open-ended component (you'll write almost the entire proof yourself). Please take this into account when planning how to work on the assignment.

## Part 1: Inferring specifications

See [Inferring specifications](./assignment3/infer_specs.md).

## Part 2: Verify factorial

See [Factorial](./assignment3/factorial_proof.md).

## Part 3: Linked lists

## Part 4: Queue using two stacks
