# Assignment 3: Verifying Go programs

In this assignment you'll verify imperative programs written in Go. All your proofs should be carried out in the exercises repo (sys-verif-fa24-proofs). The various parts of the assignment are divided among files in `src/sys_verif/assignment3`; each part is independent.

Submit your work by running `./etc/prepare-submit` and uploading `hw.tar.gz` to the Canvas assignment.

Part 1 is a tutorial and part 2 is a warmup. Part 5 has an open-ended component (you'll write almost the entire proof yourself). Please take this into account when planning how to work on the assignment.
