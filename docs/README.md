This is a graduate-level class on _systems verification_: how to mathematically prove the correctness of programs with machine-checked proofs. A core technique throughout the class is _separation logic_, which we will use to reason about real-world programs written in Go, including using loop invariants, reasoning about slices, pointer-based data structures, and concurrency. Programming assignments will involve proving theorems with the Coq proof assistant.
