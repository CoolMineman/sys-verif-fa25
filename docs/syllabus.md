# Syllabus

## Learning objectives

By the end of this class, you should be able to:

- Articulate the guarantees of formal verification
- Verify programs using separation logic
- Prove theorems in the Coq proof assistant

## Prerequisites

The two main requirements are "mathematical maturity" and "programming experience." Mathematical maturity means you're comfortable with the precision of using and learning new math, which is required to understand program proofs. Programming experience is needed since the proofs will be programs written in the Coq proof assistant, and also to appreciate the value of correct software.

You do not need background using Coq.

You do not need to have used Go before, even though we will verify code written in it; you should be able to get up-to-speed in reading Go quickly.

## Assignments

There will be two programming exercises in Coq, one written theory assignment, and a final project in Coq. See the [assignments page](./assignments/) for details.

Grading: TBD

Hand-in: submit to Canvas

## Late policy

For the programming exercises and theory assignment, you get 3 "late days" to use throughout the semester. You don't need to tell me to use them, just submit late. If you have extenuating circumstances and need more time, let me know as soon as possible.

## Student well-being

I realize this class isn't the only thing in your life. If this class ever feels overwhelming on top of whatever else you're responsible for, please let me know and we can work something out. Do this early! I don't want it to stress you out, I want you to learn something.

Students are encouraged to learn about and utilize UW-Madison's mental health services and/or other resources as needed. Visit [uhs.wisc.edu](https://www.uhs.wisc.edu/) or call University Health Services at (608) 265-5600 to learn more.

## Course communication

If you have any questions, please email me at <chajed@wisc.edu>. If you want to meet, I'm happy to set up a time - send me an email with some suggested times.
