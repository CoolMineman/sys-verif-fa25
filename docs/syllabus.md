# Syllabus

## Learning objectives

By the end of this class, you should be able to:

- Articulate the guarantees of formal verification
- Write and understand specifications
- Verify simple programs in an imperative language


## Prerequisites

There is no specific course or background that is required to learn verification. However, some "mathematical maturity" and programming skill is needed: the mathematical maturity since we will be stating and proving precise theorems, the programming since you'll be learning a new programming language (Coq) to write proofs in.

## Assignments

There will be two programming exercises in Coq, one written theory assignment, and a final project in Coq. See the [assignments page](./assignments.md) for details.

Grading: TBD

Handin: TBD (probably Canvas)

## Late policy

For the programming exercises and theory assignment, you get 3 "late days" to use throughout the semester. You don't need to tell me to use them, just submit late. If you have extenuating circumstances and need more time, let me know as soon as possible.

## Student well-being

I realize this class isn’t the only thing in your life. If this class ever feels overwhelming on top of whatever else you're responsible for, please let me know and we can work something out. Do this early! I don’t want it to stress you out, I want you to learn something.

Students are encouraged to learn about and utilize UW-Madison's mental health services and/or other resources as needed. Visit uhs.wisc.edu or call University Health Services at (608) 265–5600 to learn more.
